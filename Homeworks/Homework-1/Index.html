        <h2 align = "center">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Before we can get started on how to perform different electricity calculations, lets indroduce the different terms that will be used. The following four terms will be used: 
        </p>
        
       <ul>
       <li><a name = "Current"><strong><em>Current</em></strong>-this is known as the time rate of flow of electric charge, in the direction that a positive moving charge would take and having magnitude equal to the quantity of charge per unit time: measured in amperes &ldquo;A&rdquo;.
        </a>
        </li>

            </figure>
        
        <li><a name = "Voltage"><strong><em>Voltage</em></strong>-We define voltage as the amount of potential energy between two points on a circuit. One point has more charge than another. This difference in charge between the two points is called voltage. It is measured in volts, which, technically, is the potential energy difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it.The unit &ldquo;volt&rdquo; is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who invented what is considered the first chemical battery. Voltage is represented in equations and schematics by the letter &ldquo;V&rdquo;.

        <li><a name = "Resistance"><strong><em>Risitance</em></strong>-Resistance is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current. It is represented by the uppercase letter &ldquo;R&rdquo;.

            <h2 align = "center"><a name = "Ohm's Law">Ohm's Law</a></h2>
            <p>
               Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship
